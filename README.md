# Linked List

## My implementation of a linked list in JavaScript

The created list consists of Node objects. Each Node's nextNode property points to the next Node.

### My linked list has several methods/functions

* append(value)
    Adds an element to the end of the list.
* prepend(value)
    Adds an element to the start of the list.
